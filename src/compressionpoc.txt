compressionpoc is test code used to evaluate whether MRT files containing
BGP updates can be usefully compressed on disk by eliminating duplicate
information. The components of the update record containing everything
except the timestamp and routes (NLRIs) are stored in a hash file and a
reference to that file is made in the saved entry. If that data is already
there from a prior BGP update then the reference to the pre-existing record
is kept. That data includes BGP attributes such as the AS path, neighbor AS
and so on.

In tests with one month of BGP data from routeviews, about a 40% reduction
in disk storage was observed with more than 9 of 10 records duplicating
data in a prior record.

Further avenues for exploration:

1) De-duplicate the routes (NRLIs) too.

2) Evaluate compression techniques for MRT files containing BGP table dumps.
In addition to the compression methods used for updates, table dumps should be
able to be stored as occasional full dumps plus differentials against that
last full dump.
